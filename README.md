### Project Goal
The aim of this project is to build an application from scratch and to the end. I will adhere to
common JavaScript and especially React practices, but also utilize tools like Git as was it a
team project, serious commit messages, pull requests and in the future CI/CD including
deployment pipelines and automation. I want the workflow and development process to simulate a
 real work environment, where transparency and seriousity is appreciated and I will minimize the
  small "hacks" that can be common in personal projects, because no one is there to pinpoint the
   bad practices/"hacks".
   
### Content
It is a personal website which I can develop and mold continously to my liking. Initially it will
 be a blog like website, but I would also like for example to have a tab in which I can track my
 current investments through an API. The backend is
 Firebase for now.

### How to run it
I assume node is installed

To install the packages
```
npm install
```
to run the project on http://localhost:3000/
```
npm start
```
