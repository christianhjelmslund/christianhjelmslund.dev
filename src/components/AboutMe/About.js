            <h1 className={styles.title}>About me {<Emoji symbol={"ü§ôüèº"}/>}</h1>
            <p className={styles.content}>
                My name is Christian Hjelmslund and I'm 25 years old. I'm studying a Master's in Computer Science and Engineering at the Technical University of Denmark while working as a Student Software Engineer @ {<a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.veo.co/">Veo Technologies</a>}. I am passionate about tech, innovation and science. This passion is driven by curiosity and eagerness to play with the newest technologies. This can vary from developing a new app to deploy a smart contract on a blockchain. It can also mean happily cheering on while watching a live stream of a SpaceX rocket being deployed into orbit (#nerd). However, it is not all about tech. I am a happy person that tries to bring a positive attitude wherever I go. I enjoy Friday nights out with friends, travelling, networking, investing, working out and lastly, I have a great passion for football.

            <h1 className={styles.title}>What is the point of this website? <Emoji symbol={"ü§î"}/></h1>
            <p className={styles.content}>
                I'd say there are several points with this site. First and foremost, it should be seen as a digital platform which I can use to play with, develop some components and act as some sort of interactive resume. This is stuff like tracking my own investment portfolio, links to social media platforms and more. Honestly, I'm not even sure yet.
            </p>
            <p className={styles.content}>
                Besides treating this my own digital multi-purpose swiss army knife, I'd also like to be able to write some posts for everyone to read. The core focus will be on technology, software development and the life of a developer, but I will probably also aim a bit wide with some of it. That could include posts about investments, financial independence and maybe even politics. I know that combining all this stuff together might sound a bit messy from a user experience point of view, but I think it'll be fine. Again, view it at as a place where I can learn, create stuff, write posts etc. but it just happens to be public. Hopefully, the posts can be interesting or relevant to some of you.</p>
            <p className={styles.content}>
                If I were to declare a target audience, I'd say it is people who are interested in tech or at least curious about it. If you are the type of person that have wondered what a cookie actually is, but never actually taken action to find out, you might enjoy it. Some of the topics will also be aimed for people who already know how to code, build software and in general have a high knowledge within the domain. However, as a future engineer it is crucial(!) to be able to explain the stuff you do to non-technical people. I hope that I can learn that here.</p>
            <p className={styles.content}>
                Alright, so I think you get the gist. I'd say a good starting point is to read the post on why I build this site the way I did. {<NavLink to={'posts/post1'}>EnjoyÔ∏è</NavLink>}
